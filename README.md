# RibosomeProfilingDataAnalysis
This GitHub repository is for the documentation done in this research project. All scripts are uploaded in the order they were performed. To be able to replicate each step, the FASTQ files are need to start the analysis.
The first scripts was only to practise using the SRA tool, but doesn't provide any output that was used in this project. It is therefore possible to start with the second step directly, namely doing the quality control of the FASTQ files.
